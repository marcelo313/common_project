          />

          <p>
            Biscuit is a 2 year old shiba inu dog. Shiba inus are energetic and playful dogs. Biscuit
            enjoys running outside in circles and then laying down in the grass in the sun for hours.
            He also likes going for occasional swims.
          </p>
          <p>
            As energetic as Biscuit is, he also likes to relax. He loves to sleep in his dog bed and
            watch Netflix with his owners. His favorite treat is apples.
          </p>

          <h2>Honey</h2>

          <img
            src="images/honey_main.jpeg"
            alt="Honey is a medium-sized golden retriever with honey brown fur. She has a white patch of fur on her chest and her right eye is smaller than her left."
            width="400"
          />

          <p>
            Honey’s favorite thing in the world is swimming. Even if it is the middle of January and
            half of the lake is frozen, Honey will be in the water. She is a smart swimmer, so when my
            brother and I go underwater, she will follow our air bubbles and be waiting for us when we
            come up for air.
          </p>
          <p>
            While most dogs like to chase balls or sticks, Honey likes to chase rocks. She will even
            chase rocks into the water and stick her whole face in the water to try and find the rock
            thrown. Chasing rocks is her main form of exercise right now as she refuses to go on walks
            from our house. If we drive her to another spot and walk from there, Honey will go on a
            walk but she refuses to leave our driveway when we try to walk from home. Finally one
            other Honey-ism is that her safe place is bathtubs. Many times our family has woken up in
            the middle of the night and found Honey is a bathtub.

          <h2>Milktea</h2>

          <img src="images/milktea_main.jpg" alt="Milktea taking nap" width="400" />

          <p>
            Milktea is a Scottish fold with a personality of a princess. She loves her veggies and
            refuses to eat anything dropped on the ground. She makes it clear when she has a demand of
            any sort by complaining in a loud, distinguished manner. If what she says could be
            translated, it probably would be, “This is atrocious, the water container has been empty
            for the 3rd time this week. I want to see the manager.”
          </p>
          <p>
            Despite her cuteness and royalty, she actually suffers from a genetic disorder
            intentionally brought upon by humans. I highly advise against keeping a Scottish fold
            because they are in constant pain when they reach around 2 years old. Cartilage
            accumulates around her paw joints and tail joints and it becomes painful for them to even
            walk. She is living evidence of human’s cruelty of breeding animals to look pretty while
            sacrificing the animals’ health.
          </p>
